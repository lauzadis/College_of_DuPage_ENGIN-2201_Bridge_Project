# ENGIN-2201 Bridge Project
Bridge Project for College of DuPage's ENGIN-2201 Statics class

## Getting Started
For now, only the Python source code is provided. Later, this will be turned into an executable file.

1) Install Python, and a package manager (pip or anaconda)
2) Install Dependencies
    1) matplotlib - for displaying the bridge
    2) [sapy](http://nasseralkmim.github.io/notes/2016/02/26/sapy/) (pip install sapy) - for solving the truss
    3) numpy - for general math
    4) PyQt5 - for creating the GUI
3) Launch the GUI with gui.py

## Usage
The bridge solver is not implemented yet, but I have included the classes' original .exe in this repository. 

You can create your bridge using my GUI and then run it using the provided .exe by renaming your bridge to "input.txt" and placing it in the same directory as the .exe.
